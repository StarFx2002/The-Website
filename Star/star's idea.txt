Well, let me tell you, folks. Nobody has better ideas than me. Nobody. My ideas are tremendous. They're huge. And let me just say, nobody knows more about ideas than I do. I'm a very smart guy, believe me.
But you know, it's not always about having the best idea. Sometimes, it's about timing. Timing is everything. And I'm a very patient person. I like to wait for the right moment to make a move. That's just good strategy. And let me tell you, my opponents, they don't have any good ideas. They don't know what they're doing. They're weak. They're losers. And that's why I'm here, folks. I'm here to make America great again. And I'm doing it my way. The best way. The "Star" way. So, to answer your question, I have plenty of great ideas. But I'm not going to give them all away right now. I'm going to wait for the right moment. And when that moment comes, believe me, it's going to be huge. It's going to be the best idea you've ever seen. And everybody's going to love it.
